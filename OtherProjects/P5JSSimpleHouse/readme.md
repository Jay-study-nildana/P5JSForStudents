# p5 JS Simple House

This is a P5 JS project that attempts to draw a house.

Look at [ReferenceHandDrawing.jpg](ReferenceHandDrawing.jpg).

When the code is done, it should look something like that drawing. 

As of now, the visuals are 'extremely' rough, boring and dull. However, I plan to dig deep into P5.JS as part of my Random Stuff Project. So, it will get better for sure.

# TODO - Version History

Update it in the docs.

# Coding Stages

I took screenshots as the code was being built. Find them here - [CodeImageStages](CodeImageStages)

Note : The project has 'click' to download screenshot option enabled.

# Note About 'NoLoop()

This project is focused on drawing, rather than animation. 

I may eventually add code related to animation but as of now, my focus is strictly on drawing and using P5 JS as a 2D canvas.
