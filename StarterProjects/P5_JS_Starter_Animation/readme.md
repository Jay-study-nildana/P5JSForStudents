# Files in the project

1. sketch.js - the main file where you write your code.
1. globalvariables.js - the file where I keep all global variables. Yes, in JavaScript we dont really recommend global variables. However, we are doing animation here. some rules need to be broken.
1. mover.js - where I put all the 'satellite' things. the many moons.
