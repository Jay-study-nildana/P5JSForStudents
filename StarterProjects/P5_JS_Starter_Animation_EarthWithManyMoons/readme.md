# P5_JS_Starter_Animation_2 - Earth With Many Moons

A quick implementation of attraction. Resembles moon around earth. Kind of. we dont get a perfect circular movement though.

I decided to use an array for the moon thing so we have dozens of celestial objects trying to circle the center figure.

# Files in the project

1. sketch.js - the main file where you write your code.
1. globalvariables.js - the file where I keep all global variables. Yes, in JavaScript we dont really recommend global variables. However, we are doing animation here. some rules need to be broken.
1. mover.js - where I put all the 'satellite' things. the many moons.
1. attractor.js - the center earth which 'pulls' the satellites towards it.
