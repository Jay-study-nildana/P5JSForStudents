# P5 JS For Students

P5 JS is one of those simple JS libraries that anybody can use. Here, I put some of my learnings for students to explore.

Note : Image generated from code in ChapterZero > IntroductionRandomWalks. This is one of my favorites, because, it just looks so cool.

Note : Each folder contains an example output image. This should help you get to the exact code that you are looking for, based on the appearance.

Note : I am, ultimately, just a simple tutor who has some decent tutoring skills. Most of the code you see here is borrowed from open source, free code written by someone, somewhere, from all over the internet. I have ensured that the original author is credited in every project here.

# Live Editor

1. https://editor.p5js.org/

I am not a big fan of this. I would recommend you use it when you really, really, dont have another option. Or, when you want to show stuff to your colleagues in a easy, sharable link. I personally prefer a combination of github and screenshots/video links to showcase my P5.JS work.
